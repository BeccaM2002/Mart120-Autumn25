 “You god awful bloody clock with …  punctuality lacking, your fulfilled melodi to  be shove up my asses ears by yur mum before me bed to death!” I spit and mutter.

<br><br>
“You useless piece of cogs, long loved only to end up in bed with a man old’n dead,” I chortle.
<br><br>

My scruf hackles.
<br><br>
“Harry!!!!! Fix the bloody arse …. Me Pie,” me old wife shrills.
<br><br>
Varied the soun’d of birds and bays shake the floor timbers.
<br><br>
Me mouths corners sink into my cheeks as a child’s cackle breasts the tongue. “Yes Dear.”<p></p>
